            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            
            <p>This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect, use, store, and share your information, as well as how you can access, update, control, and protect your personal information.</p>

            <h2>I. Information We Collect</h2>
            
            <p>To provide you with cosmetic product management services, we only collect and use necessary information. Based on the functions of the App, we may collect the following information:</p>
            
            <ol>

                <li><strong>Product images</strong>: If you choose to add images to products, we will access your photo library or camera and store the images you select.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>II. How We Use the Collected Information</h2>
            
            <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the basic functions of the App, such as product recording, expiration reminders, and data statistics;</li>
                <li>Develop new services or features;</li>
                <li>Provide customer support;</li>

                <li>Resolve technical issues and optimize application performance.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>III. Data Storage</h2>
            
            <p>The App uses local storage, meaning all your data is stored locally on your device and is not uploaded to the cloud or servers. This means:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Your personal data is completely under your control;</li>
                <li>If you uninstall the App or change devices, your data cannot be recovered unless you have created a backup;</li>
                <li>We cannot remotely access or control your data.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>IV. Data Security</h2>
            
            <p>We take your data security very seriously and have implemented reasonable technical measures to protect your personal information:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>All data is stored in the secure area of your device, protected by the iOS system;</li>
                <li>The App does not transmit any data to the network, avoiding network transmission risks;</li>
                <li>We regularly review our data processing procedures to ensure compliance with the latest privacy protection requirements.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>V. Information Sharing</h2>
            
            <p>We commit to not selling, trading, or transferring your personal information to third parties. The App will not share your personal information with any third party, except:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>With your explicit consent;</li>
                <li>To comply with legal regulations, court orders, or other legal procedures;</li>
                <li>To protect our rights, property, or safety, as well as the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>VI. Your Rights</h2>
            
            <p>According to relevant laws and regulations, you have the following rights regarding your personal information:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Right of access: You have the right to access the information we collect about you;</li>
                <li>Right of correction: You have the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information;</li>
                <li>Right of deletion: You have the right to delete your personal information;</li>
                <li>Right to withdraw consent: You have the right to withdraw any consent you have previously given.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Because the App uses local storage, you can exercise the above rights by directly editing or deleting related data within the App, or by uninstalling the App to completely delete all your data.</p>
            
            <h2>VII. Children's Privacy</h2>
            
            <p>The App is not targeted at children under 4 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 4. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete that information from our records.</p>
            
            <h2>VIII. Third-Party Links</h2>
            
            <p>The App may contain links to other websites or applications. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy policies of these third-party websites or applications. We recommend that you read their privacy policies before providing personal information to any third-party website or application.</p>

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to understand how we protect your information.</p>
